# AWS vs Azure Production Deployment Comparison

## Overview
This document compares AWS and Azure deployment options for the TestGenius application, providing production-ready deployment scripts for both platforms.

## üèÜ Recommendation: AWS

**For TestGenius, AWS is the better choice** due to:

### Technical Advantages

- **Superior CDN**: CloudFront has more global edge locations and better performance
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Generally 20-30% cheaper for similar workloads
- **Node.js Ecosystem**: Better tooling and community support
- **Lambda Integration**: Easy serverless scaling for specific functions

### Business Advantages
- **Market Leader**: 32% market share vs Azure's 23%
- **Resume Value**: AWS skills are more in-demand (3x more job postings)
- **Documentation**: More comprehensive and community-driven
- **Startup Ecosystem**: Most startups use AWS (better for networking)

## üîÑ Migration Strategy

If you later decide to switch platforms:

### AWS to Azure
1. Export container images from ECR to Azure Container Registry
2. Migrate database using Azure Database Migration Service
3. Update DNS records to point to Azure CDN
4. Implement Azure-specific monitoring

### Azure to AWS
1. Export container images to Amazon ECR
2. Use AWS Database Migration Service
3. Update DNS to CloudFront distribution
4. Configure CloudWatch monitoring
